A Monad instance requires an Applicative instance which was\n      unrepresentable in TypeScript's type system without resorting to\n      techniques that don't fit into the \"interfaces with generics\" model.\n      There's also the issues with typeclasses like Ord, Setoid and Semigroup\n      which don't make much sense in JavaScript where you can compare all\n      values.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      All of these things led to the removal of typeclasses from the library.\n      With that went the Id datatype which serves no need anymore.\n      <br />\n      Since typeclasses were also the justification for having folders in the\n      library exports, now the folder structure is flat.\n      <br />\n      This means that imports like{' '}\n      <HL>{`import { Maybe } from 'purify-ts/adts/Maybe`}</HL> are now just{' '}\n      <HL>{`import { Maybe } from 'purify-ts/Maybe'`}</HL>.\n      <br />\n      The Validation module was removed for a completely different reason though\n      - the API was just too limiting and ad-hoc, hopefully it will return soon\n      in a better, more generic form.\n    </TopicDescription>\n\n    <Topic>New Maybe methods</Topic>\n    <TopicDescription>\n      The original focus for this release was better JS interop and before the\n      implementation of MaybeAsync and EitherAsync took most of my time working\n      on this project, two new methods were added to the Maybe data type.\n      <br />\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <HL>Maybe#chainNullable</HL> - The same as Maybe#chain but for\n          functions that return a nullable value instead of Maybe.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <HL>Maybe#extract</HL> - Now returns an undefined instead of null as\n          undefined is used more often to reprent missing values.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <HL>Maybe#extractNullable</HL> - The new name of Maybe#extract from\n          previous versions of purify\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </TopicDescription>\n\n    <Topic>Other changes</Topic>\n    <TopicDescription>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          There is now a \"Guides\" section for each data type which will\n          hopefully include a lot of useful information in the near future.
